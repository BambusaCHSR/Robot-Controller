# Git VCS (Version control System) With Android Studio

For our robot we used git as a version control to keep a backup of our code. This is a command line/android studio tutorial on how to setup and use it. If you don't want to use command line the Github app is a good idea it will let you do the main processes that we will be doing in the command line tools using a GUI (Graphical User Interface).

  * ##### Github app download
    * **Mac:**
      ```
      https://mac-installer.github.com/mac/GitHub%20Desktop%20222.zip
      ```

    * **Windows:**
      ```
      https://github-windows.s3.amazonaws.com/GitHubSetup.exe
      ```
    * **EULA:** </br>
      ```
      https://desktop.github.com/eula/
      ```

## Setting Up Git With Android Studio
### Configuring Android Studio To Work With Git

</br>

  1. **Mac Users:** </br> Find the ```Android Studio``` tab in the menu bar and open it. </br> </br> **Windows Users:** </br> Go to the ```Window``` tab in the menu bar and open it. </br> </br> </br>
  2. **Windows and Mac Users:** </br> Go down to ```Preferences``` and open it. </br> </br> </br>
  3. **Windows and Mac Users:** </br> In preferences find the ```Version Control```! tab and click on it. </br> The window that opens should look something like this: </br></br>![][settings] </br></br></br>
  4. **Windows and Mac Users:** </br> Click on the small + sign in the bottom left hand side of the upper box area. </br></br>![][settings circle] </br> </br> </br>
  5. **Windows and Mac Users:** </br> Once in the new window that opens up you will want to click on ```Configure VCS...``` to check wether or not git is setup properly or not. </br></br> ![][Directory circle] </br></br></br>
  6. **Windows and Mac Users:** </br> In the new window select git. </br></br>![][select git] </br></br>If there is a file directory in ```path to Git executable``` skip to step 9. If not, follow along.</br></br> ![][executable] </br></br>
  7. <p>**Mac Users:** </br> This problem means that you probably don't have git installed, if you do skip to step 8. </br> Go to:

    ```
    https://git-scm.com/download/mac
    ```

    to get the installer. </br></br></p>
  **Windows Users:** </br> This problem means that you probably don't have git installed, if you do skip to step 8. </br> Go to:
    ```
    https://git-scm.com/download/win
    ```
    to get the installer. </br></br></br>
  8. **Mac Users:** </br> After installing git go back to the window we stopped on last. In the field type: ```/usr/local/bin/git``` Then hit ok. </br></br> ![][executable] </br></br>
  **Windows Users:** </br> After installing git go back to the window we stopped on last. In the field type: ```C:\Program Files\Git\bin\git.exe``` if you have a 62-but system or ```C:\Program Files (x86)\Git\bin\git.exe``` if you have a 32-bit system. Then hit ok.</br></br> ![][executable] </br></br></br>
  9. **Mac and Windows Users:** </br> After setting up the git executable if you needed to. You need to put the desired repository directory in the directory box. </br></br> ![][Directory circle2] </br></br> You only need to have the ```TeamCode``` folder, so it will look something like: ```<DIRECTORY TO FOLDER>/ftc-app-master/TeamCode/``` Then after you have put your desired directory in, go to step 10. </br></br></br>
  10. **Mac and Windows Users:** </br> After adding the directory you need to set the VCS to git. </br></br> ![][Directory git] </br></br> After that hit ```Apply``` then ```Ok```(if any errors pop up ignore them we will fix those in *Configuring Git*).

### Configuring Git

Now that Android studio recognizes that directory as a repository you have to actually create one. You can do this from the Github app but I will only be using Android Studio's build in ```Terminal``` feature. ***This assumes that you have at least a little experience with command line if you don't know what I am referring to look it up on your own.***

1. You will want to log into git to start off. ***This assumes you have a github account if not make one.*** </br> Go into the in the bottom bar of android studio and open: ```Terminal```*(Or just open terminal (Mac) or cmd (Windows) either way works).* </br> Once there type:
  ```
  $ git config --global user.name "<YOUR GIT USERNAME>"
  ```
  and
  ```
  $ git config --global user.email "<YOUR GIT LOGIN EMAIL>"
  ```
This sets up the global git settings to use your account. </br></br>

2. After you have logged in, navigate to the directory you made Android studio look for a repository by using the ```cd``` command. </br> Once you are there type:
  ```
  $ git init
  ```
This initiates the git repository so you may now close any errors you had. </br></br>
3. You will want to add the local (where you are in the file system at the time of the command) repository (folder that you went to using ```cd```).</brr> To do that type:
  ```
  $ git add .
  ```
If you want to add individual files that you need to git type:
  ```
  $ git add <FILE NAME>
  ```
If you want to add whole folders do:
  ```
  $ git add <FOLDER NAME>/*
  ```
  </br>
4. The next step is the make your first ```commit``` of what you have. </br> To do this type:
  ```
  $ git commit -m "<YOUR COMMIT MESAGE>"
  ```
A commit message is a short blip of information that describes the changes you made to the contents of the repository.</br></br>
5. You now want to sync this repository with one you have already created on the website ***This assumes that you know, and have made a repository on the github.com website with your account for the project.*** </br> To do this type:
  ```
  $ git remote add <NAME OF ONLINE REPOSITORY> <REPOSITORY URL>
  ```
  After that we want to verify that that url works to do this type:
  ```
  $ git remote -v
  ```
  Next we want to push what we committed earlier:
  ```
  $ git push -u <NAME OF ONLINE REPOSITORY> master
  ```
  "master" is the "branch" that you are pushing to. If you have a different branch that you want to push to use that branch name instead of master. I will not be going over how to make/use branches in this markdown file though. But if you want experiment go for it.

## Using Git After Setting Up

### General Use
After you get used to Git is really a very simple process. After you make changes that you are happy with and want to upload you commit them by typing:
```
$ git commit
```
While you are in the local repository directory. After you have made all the edits for a certain amount of time (for example after every day's work) you push all your commits (changes) to the online repository by typing:
```
$ git push
```
While in the local repository directory. Every time you want to add new files you just need to type:
```
$ git add <FILE NAME>
```
Then commit it.

### Downloading and setting up a git repository that you made and have set up online

1. Navigate to a folder where you want to put the repository on your computer in Terminal (Mac) or CMD (Windows).</br></br>
2. You next want to "clone" what you have online to the folder you just made. </br> You do this by typing:
  ```
  $ git clone <YOUR REPOSITORY URL>
  ```
  </br>
3. Next you will need to initiate that repository for your computer. </br> You do this by typing:
  ```
  $ git init
  ```
While in the repository directory. **Make sure that you are in the repository directory because when you clone a repository it creates a new folder named after the online name** </br> </br>
4. After that make sure that everything is added by typing:
  ```
  $ git add .
  ```
  </br>
5. Then you will be able to commit it and push it.
